The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has shown us the the vulnerability of our species to the invisible workings of the microbial world. It has shown us the resilience and strength of health care workers, educators, small business owners, and average citizens alike in the wake of massive societal disruption. We have suffered loss and grief, anger and frustration, distance and isolation. One year in, we are still faced with pressing questions and decisions about how we move forward.</p>\n<p>The virus is a very spectacular phenomena of biology. Neither living or dead, these replicants have intricate relationships with host organisms. Despite common belief, often times this relationship is <strong>beneficial to the host</strong>. Often, the are harmless passengers on our meat vessel, simply enjoying the ride. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the virus is quite the pestilence however. You can read about its virulence elsewhere—I'd like to focus the energy of this post on discussing some of my research and opinions on the pandemic at large.</p>\n<h2>The \"Gold Standard\" of Testing</h2>\n<p>Around the world the gold standard for detecting presence of the virus in a individual is the rt-PCR method (quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction). Developed in 1985 by Kary Mullis, the PCR technique allows scientists to make many copies of a scarce segment of DNA/RNA from a tissue sample. PRC is used in everything from cancer screening to food safety testing. It allows for the detection of a very specific target nucelic acid sequence, but is not necesarily indicative of the presence of an active organism associated with that sequence. In Mullis own words, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Xc0Kysti6Kc?t=30\" title=\"Kary Mullis on PCR\">\"with PCR—if you do it well—you can find almost anything, in anybody.\"</a> In other words, PRC allows the agent to amplify a minute quantity of viral RNA into something of clinical significance. The number of amplication cylces use for a given PCR is known as the cycle threshold (CT). <a href=\"https://someyoutubelink\" title=\"Cycle threshold and infectivity\">Although a correlation has been shown between detection of viral RNA at a lower CT and increased infectivity</a>, the CT is rarely reported with the binary test results.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the PRC test <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle\" title=\"PCR Testing Overview\">does not distinguish between infectious and non-infectious virus.</a> Tests can pick up dead or non-viable fragments of viral RNA—if you beat off the virus 4 months ago, you could still test positive. To detect true infectivity of a sample, the isolation of the virus by culture methods is required. Unfortunately, such methods are time consuming, complex, and must be conducted in specialized laboratories with biocontainment facilities. Due to this burden, viral cultures is rarely being done. <strong>A positive PCR test in no way equates to being infected or to being infectious.</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“It is important to note that detecting viral material by PCR does not indicate that the virus is fully intact and infectious, i.e. able to cause infection in other people. The isolation of infectious virus from positive individuals requires virus culture methods. These methods can only be conducted in laboratories with specialist containment facilities and are time consuming and complex.” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/niall_boylan/status/1301285620996861953?lang=en\" title=\"Niall Bolan on PCR\">7</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In an ironic plot twist, Florida of all states, <a href=\"https://www.flhealthsource.gov/files/Laboratory-Reporting-CT-Values-12032020.pdf\" title=\"Florida Surgeon General&#x27;s memo on COVID-19 testing\">is now requiring testing laboratories to report the cycle threshold values and their reference ranges</a>, along with the positive or negative result.</p>\n<h2>Flawed Models and Projections</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Back in March, Dr. Neil Ferguson released a paper detailing his epidemiological model that predicted grave consequences with up to 40 million deaths globally if no interventions were taken to combat the spread of COVID-19.  Ferguson is a mathematical epidemiologist from the Imperial College of London with strong ties to the World Health Organization.  Back in 2009 he issued </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Excess Deaths and Hospitalizations</h2>\n<p>It is undisputable that we are seeing significant excess deaths (deaths from all causes compared to last year). But as many immunologists, virologists, and public health professionals are beginning to point out, <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/eci.13423\" title=\"Global perspective of COVID-19 epidemiology for a full-cycle pandemic\">\"differentiating between COVID‐19 deaths and those due to harmful response measures is challenging.\"</a> People are forgoing treatment for life threatening ailments due to the perceived threat of SARS-CoV-2</p>\n<p>With many false positives due to the nature of PCR testing described above, the number of deaths attributed to infection with SARS-CoV-2 is likely inflated. Just because someone has a positive PCR test and is admitted to the hospital, that does not mean that SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of their acute illness. Many patients have severe chronic illnesses, coupled with a positive PCR test, and their admittance into the hospital is being counted as a COVID-19 admittance. This inflates hospitalization rates and paints a poor picture of the severity of the pandemic. Furthermore, anyone who dies with a positive PCR test, regardless of their co-morbidities or the true cause of death is being counted as a COVID-19 death. You could literally break your leg and die of femeral artery bleeding but because you tested positive a day earlier, you would be counted in the pandemic death toll.</p>\n<p>The pandemic has severely disrupted global health programs (think Peace Corps, etc.), and shifted emphasis and funding away from prevention of much more virulent and widespread diseases.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Putting projections together, the excess deaths from the measures taken is likely to be much larger than the COVID‐19 deaths, for example, disruption of tuberculosis programmes alone is expected to cause 1.4 million extra deaths over the next 5 years and the death toll from famine can be even more staggering\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Mob Mentality, Shaming, and the Politics of Fear</h2>\n<p>Aside from the acute risk of getting sick or dying, one of the scariest pieces of this pandemic is the blind acceptance of the imposed draconian and authoritarian measures by people around the world. While there are real reasons to be concerned about this new virus, <em><strong>the public fear surrounding COVID-19 has been elevated to levels that are completely out of proportion with the actual risks.</strong></em> Many will say that they are \"following the science\" but it is unlikely the average citizen is reading, let alone analyzing the heap of new scientific literature that has been published since the beginning of the outbreak.</p>\n<p>Instead, we rely heavily on the media, and namely social media, to define the narrative for us. And terrifyingly, many opinions that are contrary to the mainstream are being censored. For example <a href=\"http:?/michaelyeatonvideo\" title=\"Dr Michael Yeaton believes the pandemic is over\">this video</a> containing a cautionay dialog from Dr. Michael Yeadon, was ripped from YouTube. As a biologist and pharmacologist who specializes in respiratory health, the man is highly qualified to speak on the topic. <strong>Even if what someone like Dr. Michael Yeadon is saying contains some innacuracies, this blatant censorship sets a dangerous precedent.</strong></p>\n<p>The pro-censorship argument is obviously the classic: you musn't yell \"FIRE\" in a crowded room that is not burning. Yet the outcries against these excessive lockdowns and quarantine measures are doing nothing comprable. On the contrary, the room is certainly on fire, and the media and our politicians are the arsonists. Against the grain and in spite of wave of Stalinesque censorship, science, data, and opinions still emerge that support the idea that, perhaps, our extreme reaction to the pandemic may be short sighted and end up doing more harm than good.</p>\n<p>Without the whole picture painted for them, it seems that the masses are dedicated to a religion of unquestioning obedience. It seems we have lost the ability to think freely and critically about the world at large.  Instead, we are welcoming tyrannical policies with zero room for debate.  As we saw with the onset of the holidays, many took to their platforms of choice to dispell the evils of the usual Thanksgiving celebrations. Wherever you stand on the COVID-19 situation, it is harmful and nonsensical to shame people for spending time with their family and friends. Our elders, moreso than anyone, need to be loved, supported, and interacted with. If you're sick, yes wear a mask around grandma or wait to visit, but do not use this virus as an excuse to neglect your elderly loved ones. Assinine and reactionary policies have further isolated our senior citizens for the sake of \"keeping them safe.\" </p>\n<ul>\n<li>seems to me that a mask is more of a symbolic token used to gain entry to the grocery store and other public innards rather than a device used to protect oneself from a deadly disease. And while I do believe in the ability of masks to prevent the spread of respiratory disease, the inconsistent and unscientific approach to mask policy is disheartening. We are masking our children, largely unnaffected by this viral plight, who so desperately rely on facial language for their behavioral development.</li>\n<li>if 80-90% have \"background immuninity\" why is a vaccine needed?</li>\n<li>biological evolutionary change</li>\n<li>vaccination vs gained immunity via environment</li>\n<li>manditory vaccinations and medical freedom/sovergeingty</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Financial and Social Impacts of Lockdowns</h2>\n<p>Financial crises, unemployment, depression, and isolation have all been shown to increase mortality from all causes.</p>\n<p>As global markets reach new all time highs, so do unemployment rates. The dichotomy is illucidating: large and highly capitalized players are profitting at the expense of the average citizen. I will save the technocracy discussion for a later post, but I will emphasize that our reactionary policies to this pandemic have dramatically increased our reliance on technologies that are yielding their creators massive profits.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>Fear can be an incredibly powerful motivator of human behavior. I urge you to do your own research and come to your own conclusions. I have immense confidence in the collective brain power of humanity. We have achieved incredible feats, from the Pyramids to the internet, and we will overcome.</p>\n<h2></h2>","frontmatter":{"date":"November 28, 2020","slug":"/blog/opinions-on-the-pandemic","title":"Opinions on the Pandemic"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/opinions-on-the-pandemic"}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
