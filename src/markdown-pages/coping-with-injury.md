The year started of in royal fashion, with a roomates trip to the Baja.  All was well until an unfortunate beach volleyball incident obliterated my left knee.

I had hopped up and tipped a ball at the net and landed gracefully without issue, but to my chagrin one of my buddies on the opposing team recklessly dove for my well placed touch, where he met my planted left thigh with his shoulder, nearly 200 pounds, and the force of an overzealous recreational athlete.

The first doctor who examined my MRI bluntly said "its not looking good."  In addition to a full tear of my ACL and a partial PCL tear, my MCL was also fully torn at the distal tibial attachment. It was immediately evident that this injury would leave me crippled without surgical intervention, and thus began my healing journey.
