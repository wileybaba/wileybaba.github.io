There is no doubt that the world is in the midst of a pivotal watershed event. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has shown us the the vulnerability of our species to the invisible workings of the microbial world. It has shown us the resilience and strength of health care workers, educators, small business owners, and average citizens alike in the wake of massive societal disruption. We have suffered loss and grief, anger and frustration, distance and isolation. One year in, we are still faced with pressing questions and decisions about how we move forward.

The virus is a very spectacular phenomena of biology. Neither living or dead, these replicants have intricate relationships with host organisms. Despite common belief, often times this relationship is **beneficial to the host**. Sometimes, the virus is a harmless passenger on a meat vessel, simply enjoying the ride. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the virus is quite the pestilence however. You can read about its virulence elsewhere--I'd like to focus the energy of this post on discussing my opinions on the following facets of the global reaction to the spread of this novel coronavirus:

- our current regime of testing and risk assessment
- social distancing and mask wearing
- vaccination versus gained immunity via exposure
- medical sovereignty and the risk of vaccine mandates
- mob mentality and behavior shaming
- culture of fear and lack of whole systems understanding

## The "Gold Standard" of Testing

Around the world the gold standard for detecting presence of the virus in a individual is the rt-PCR method (reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction). Developed in 1985 by Kary Mullis, the PCR technique allows scientists to make many copies of a scarce segment of DNA from a tissue sample. PRC is used in everything from cancer screening to food safety testing. It allows for the detection of a very specific target nucelic acid sequence, but is not necesarily indicative of the presence of an active organism associated with that sequence. In Mullis own words, "with PCR–if you do it well–you can find almost anything, in anybody." In other words, PRC allows the agent to amplify a minute quantity of viral DNA into something of clinical significance.

The issue is that the PRC test "does not distinguish between infectious and non-infectious virus." And although a correlation has been shown between detection at a lower cycle threshold (ct) and increased infectivity, the ct is rarely reported with the binary test results.

- yes, we are seeing significant excess deaths. but "differentiating between COVID‐19 deaths and those due to harmful response measures is challenging"
- false positives bumping up the number of covid deaths, just because a PCR positive came back and someone died
- "Putting projections together, the excess deaths from the measures taken is likely to be much larger than the COVID‐19 deaths, for example, disruption of tuberculosis programmes alone is expected to cause 1.4 million extra deaths over the next 5 years and the death toll from famine can be even more staggeringPutting projections together, the excess deaths from the measures taken is likely to be much larger than the COVID‐19 deaths, for example, disruption of tuberculosis programmes alone is expected to cause 1.4 million extra deaths over the next 5 years and the death toll from famine can be even more staggering"
- Peace Corps, dunzo
- public fear of Covid has been elevated to levels that are completely out of proportion to the actual danger
- fear is being driven by innapropriate use of PCR testing as described above.
- financial crises, unemployment, depression, isolation, all shown to increase mortality
- if recurrent infection is possible, what the fuck is a vaccine going to do?
- if 80-90% have "background immuninity" why is a vaccine needed?
- biological evolutionary change
- vaccination vs gained immunity via environment
- manditory vaccinations and medical freedom/sovergeingty
- TRUE excess mortality is significantly up, but it is still unclear if this is due to deaths directly attributed to the virus, or to deaths due to policy surrounding the virus.
- mob mentality and lack of understanding
- concerns around true meaning of positive PCR reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction tests and information about what PCR testing actually is
- yada
  - “It is important to note that detecting viral material by PCR does not indicate that the virus is fully intact and infectious, i.e. able to cause infection in other people. The isolation of infectious virus from positive individuals requires virus culture methods. These methods can only be conducted in laboratories with specialist containment facilities and are time consuming and complex.”
  - Viral culture is not happening
  - excessive rounds of amplification cycles
  - Human DNA contains large swaths of viral DNA
  - think about cycle threshold and interpretations. only binary positive/negative is being reported, and not what ct was necessary to detect virus. positive test does not equate to being infected OR being infectious
  - PRC can pick up dead/non-viable/non-viral fragments of viral rna
